# The physical computer

This introductory part of the curriculum focuses on your computer itself. All you really need to know about are

- the power button to turn your computer on,
- the display (or screen/monitor), which is built into your laptop or plugged into your computer,
- the keyboard, which can be used for typing or for entering *shortcuts* to do different things on your computer, and
- the mouse (or trackpad), which is used to move the *cursor* around the desktop.

## The power button

This button should be easy to find on your computer. If you're using a laptop, it's usually above your keyboard on the right-hand side. Typically this button is used to power your device on.

> It's not typically recommended to use the power button to turn your device off, even though it *is* capable of it. Usually, you'd only want to hold the power button to turn your device off if the computer is frozen or not responding at all.

## The display

The monitor is built into your laptop and shows you a desktop environment where any task you want to complete is generally done. There are usually buttons on your keyboard to turn the brightness up and down.

## The keyboard

This is where you'll be doing all of your typing. Most keyboards use a QWERTY layout, which is taught in typing classes. It's definitely a good idea to learn to use it without looking because it'll speed up your experience when dealing with computers.

There are lines (or bumps) underneath the `[F]` and `[J]` keys on your keyboard. This is an easy way to find where you should rest your hands.

- Your left index finger should lie on top of the `[F]` key,
- your right index finger should lie on top of the `[J]` key,
- and your thumbs should lie on the `[SPACE]` key (the long key at the bottom).

### Resources to learn the keyboard

- [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) has your *recite* words on the screen by typing them as they appear. The dots between words are spaces, in which case you'd press the `[SPACE]` key.
- [Typing.com](https://www.typing.com/student/lessons) is more lesson-oriented and great for beginners.

## The mouse

Sometimes you'll use an external mouse (plugged in with a USB) and sometimes you'll use a trackpad (the rectangle underneath the keyboard on laptops). They're both used to navigate your computer by moving the cursor on-screen.

If you haven't used a mouse before, it might take awhile to get used to it. But it'll become second nature faster than you think if you keep at it.

The mouse will have a few buttons:

- The left-click button is used to select things and make sure a text input box is selected so you can type into it.
  - You'll double-click the left button when opening a file or program on the computer.
  - You can also click a file/folder, hold the click down, and drag the file/folder to different locations and *drop* it (release the click) to move it. This is called **drag-and-drop**.
- The right-click button shows you a pop-up menu with extra options to edit files.
- Sometimes there's a scroll wheel between the left and right buttons. You can scroll this up and down to scroll a website page or document up and down.

## (Optional) Extra information

Before we move on, feel free to read over this section. It might help contextualize the tools we're using to navigate and enter input into our devices.

### Hardware vs software

When speaking in terms of the elements of a computer, you'll likely stumble upon the words *hardware* and *software*. In a nutshell,

- *hardware* refers to the actual computer itself, the keyboard, mouse, display, and everything inside, including RAM, the hard drive, etc.
- *software* refers to the things that happen on your screen.

> You **use hardware** to make the **software do stuff**.

### Ports

A port is a place on your computer (usually on the sides of a laptop) where you can plug things in.

There is always at least one *port* on your computer. See the table below for a summary of some common ports.

| Port name            | Uses                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| USB-C                | A newer port that can charge your device as well as accept input from a keyboard, mouse, external hard drive, etc. |
| USB-A                | The older version of USB-C, this is used only for plugging in a keyboard, mouse, external hard drive, etc.         |
| Round-tip port       | Sometimes there will be a round port, this is used for charging your device                                        |
| Ethernet             | You can plug a cable from your home internet modem directly into your computer for internet access                 |
| Small round-tip port | This is usually a place to plug in your headphones                                                                 |
