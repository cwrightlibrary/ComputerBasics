Teaching computer basics to absolute beginners is all about building **confidence** and **physical familiarity**. Since your focus is on *using* the machine rather than the science behind it, you should prioritize tactile skills and "quality of life" navigation.

Here are the key pillars to include in your lesson plan:

---

## 1. Physical Setup & Input (The "Hands-On")

Before touching software, students need to feel comfortable with the hardware interface.

* **The Power Button:** Where it is and the difference between "Sleep," "Restart," and "Shut Down."
* **The Mouse/Trackpad:** This is often the hardest part for true beginners.
* Left-click (Select) vs. Right-click (Options).
* Double-clicking (Opening).
* Click-and-drag.


* **The Keyboard:** Focus on the "special" keys: Enter, Backspace, Spacebar, and Shift for capital letters.

---

## 2. The Desktop Environment

Think of this as the "Home Base."

* **Icons and Shortcuts:** Explain that these are like "doors" to programs.
* **The Taskbar/Dock:** How to see what programs are currently open.
* **The Start Menu (Windows) or Finder (Mac):** How to find something if it isn't on the desktop.

---

## 3. Window Management

Beginners often get overwhelmed when they "lose" a window or a program covers the whole screen.

* **Minimize, Maximize, and Close:** Explain the three buttons in the top corner.
* **Moving Windows:** How to click the top bar to slide a window out of the way.
* **Scrolling:** Using the mouse wheel or the side scroll bar to see more of a page.

## 4. Introduction to the Internet

Treat the Browser as a single "App" that leads to the rest of the world.

* **The Browser:** Identify the icon (Chrome, Edge, or Safari).
* **The Address Bar vs. Search Bar:** Explain that the top bar is for "addresses" (like a house) and the middle is for "asking questions" (Google).
* **Basic Safety:** "If a window pops up saying you have a virus or asking for money, close it immediately."

---

## 5. Filing and Saving (The "Digital Cabinet")

This is usually the steepest learning curve.

* **Folders:** Use the physical filing cabinet analogy.
* **Saving a File:** Where does it go? (Show them the "Documents" or "Downloads" folder).
* **Naming Files:** Why we don't name everything "Document1."

---

## 6. Practical "Quick Wins"

To keep students engaged, give them immediate, useful skills:

* **Taking a Screenshot:** A "picture" of the screen.
* **Copy and Paste:** The "magic" of moving text without retyping.
* **Adjusting Volume/Brightness:** Simple comfort settings.

### Tips for Teaching Beginners

* **Avoid Jargon:** Don't say "Peripheral," say "Plug-in device." Don't say "OS," say "The way the screen looks."
* **The "Hands-Off" Rule:** Never grab the student's mouse. Point at the screen and let *them* click it. They won't learn the muscle memory if you do it for them.
* **Encourage Mistakes:** Remind them that they (usually) can't break the computer by clicking the wrong button.
